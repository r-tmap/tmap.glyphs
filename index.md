# tmap.glyphs: glyphs in tmap

Provides new layer functions for **tmap** to create various types of
glyph maps. A glyph is a small chart (e.g., donut chart) shown at
specific map locations to visualize multivariate or time-series data.
The functions work with the syntax of **tmap** and allow flexible
control over size, layout, and appearance.

## Installation

Installation of **tmap.glpyhs** is straightforward:

``` r
install.packages("tmap.glyphs")
```

### Development version

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-tmap/tmap.glyphs")

# On Linux, with pak
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-tmap/tmap.glyphs")

# Or from r-universe
install.packages("tmap.glyphs", repos = c("https://r-tmap.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

For the development version, it is also recommended to install the
development version of [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) as well.
